## IT'S TIME TO UN-LEARN AND DIS-ORIENT.

This page only exists for development purposes. In particular, it exists for testing different styling and layouts for the `dis-orientation.info` website. It makes use of the file `dev.css` rather than `main.css`.

Similarly, it makes use of the `dev.html` template (rather than the `default.html` template), which, in turn, makes use of the `header-dev.html` file and the `footer-dev.html` file rather than `header.html` and `footer.html` files, respectively.

So, to summarize, if you want to test some new styling, you will need to edit `dev.css`, which is located in `~/css/`, and if you want to test some new layouts, you will need to edit `header-dev.html` and `footer-dev.html`, both of which are located in `~/_includes/`.

If any of this is unclear, get in touch with Adam.
