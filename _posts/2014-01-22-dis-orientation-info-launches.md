## And it begins!

Hello, hello folks! The Dis-orientation collective is proud to be launching `dis-orientation.info` today. We're an emerging collective that is looking for collaborators, so we don't want to say too much about what this project is, as we hope that it will continually evolve and expand as more and more folks join the collective and contribute to `dis-orientation.info`.

However, the basic intent behind the collective and its project, `dis-orientation.info`, is to create a decentralized network of individuals for centralizing critical and crucial information that disrupts the standard PR narratives of universities and brings to light a lot of the *structural* issues at universities. It is time to get critical and really think about what role universities play in society today and what role they *should* play. What harms do they contribute to? How do they contribute to the maintenance of the status quo?

And, most importantly, how can we effect change so that universities play the role that they *ought* to play, so that they no longer contribute to maintaining the status quo.

Too often, we take things for granted without critically thinking about them, especially those things that are so accepted and ingrained as 'natural' in society:

It's time to think critically about what we take for granted! It's time to **un-learn** and **dis-orient**!
