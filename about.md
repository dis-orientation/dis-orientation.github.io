## About the dis-orientation collective

It is time for the "leaders" of our universities, and all "educational" institutions to wake up from false volunteerism, tokenization that propels the "isms," standardized testing in preparation of maintaining the status quo, and take a look at the real justice-based issues at hand. The colonial "white savior" mentality will not create the much needed systematic change. Read these dis-orientation guides (sometimes referred to as DOG(s)) with a loving and open mind!

 By educating students, faculty, staff, and community members about the messy issues which need solving, our industrialized institution of "education" can start to deconstruct and work towards a more liberating future for all.

This is a student led project that welcomes new people, ideas, and issues! Interested in getting involved, or have a topic that you would like to see a particular university cover? Email us at: disorient@riseup.net or DIY by getting involved!
