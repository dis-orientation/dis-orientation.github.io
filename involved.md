## Get Involved with `dis-orientation.info`

Below, we aim to present a comprehensive guide as to how to get involved with `dis-orientation.info`. 

`dis-orientation.info` is a collaboration between individuals at a wide variety of universities. As such, the content on this website is not homogenous, though we are all committed to bringing to the fore systemic issues with universities by disrupting the normal narrative that unversities tell with dis-orienting information about our universitives. To learn more about us, you should read our [about page](http://dis-orientation.info/about). 

Below, we will focus on how to get involved if your university isn't already involved.

### <a id="step-1">Step 1: Getting in touch</a>

If your university is in the [list of universities](http://dis-orientation.info/universities) that already have content on our website, you should click on the link to visit their part of this website. There, they will have contact information, and you can get in touch with the folks at your university that are already working on dis-orienting information.

If you do not see your university listed, please get in touch with us by [contacting us](http://dis-orientation.info/contact) in order to get space on `dis-orientation.info`. Below, we will walk you through how to set up that space, how to manage it, and how to post content to it.

### Step 2: Getting your subdomain set up

`dis-orientation.info` provides each university with its own subdomain in order for them to have space to post their own content. A subdomain indicates the first half of a web address. So, in `xyz.dis-orientation.info`, `xyz` is the subdomain part, and `dis-orientation.info` is the main domain name.

In terms of setting up your subdomain, most of the initial heavy lifting will be down by `dis-orientation.info`. What is important to know is that our website is hosted using a service called GitHub. GitHub is a hosting service combined with a version control system, which is a service that tracks changes to documents.

#### Why GitHub? Why not something that might be a little easier to get set up, like Wordpress?

There are a couple of reasons why we chose to host this project on GitHub.

1. First and foremost, GitHub provides free hosting. When setting up a website, there are usually two key aspects to doing so: (i) purchasing a domain name (something like `example.com`) and (ii) paying for someone to store the files that generate your website on a server that is connected to the internet. Since GitHub provides free hosting, the only thing we have to do is pay for the domain name, `dis-orientation.info`, reducing the cost to maintain this project.

1. Second, GitHub inherently employs a version control system (VCS). This allows us to run the website in a de-centralized manner, while still having a high degree of transparency and accountability. GitHub allows its users to see all of the changes that have been made to files, who made those changes, and when they were made. (It also allows us to revert to older versions of those files, which, practically speaking, is a great provision in case of accidental deletion of any of the website files!) The dis-orientation collective highly values transparency (after all, we're trying to make universities more transparent by airing dirty laundry that they otherwise hide with massive PR campaigns or otherwise), and so using GitHub provides transparency within our collective itself by allowing all of our contributors to see who made which changes. It also easily allows us to have many universities contribute content, without necessarily having to coordinate with every other university that is involved with the collective, which we would have to do if we were sharing one Wordpress account.

1. Finally, once you've made it over the first hurdle of getting everything set up, GitHub hosting provides a really easy way to write content that is very straightforward to learn.

So, after finishing up the details of how to get your subdomain set up, we will walk you through how to use GitHub and how to write content, using the tools provided by GitHub. From then on, you're free to do whatever you wish your subdomain, so long as it contributes to dis-orienting and un-learning and so long as it does not violate any of the values and policies of our collective, as detailed in our [about page](http://dis-orientation.info/about).

First, though, we need to finish getting your subdomain set up. As mentioned above, we will do the heavy lifting in order to get your subdomain initially set up. Since the project will be hosted on GitHub, this requires telling our domain name registrar (the company managing our domain name, `dis-orientation.info`, to point the new subdomain in the direction of GitHub).

On GitHub, all parts of this website are hosted under an umbrella organization GitHub account called [`dis-orientation`](https://github.com/dis-orientation). If you visit that link, you will notice that there is a "repository" for each subdomain, as well as a repository for the main portion of the website.

We will create a new repository (or "repo", for short) for your university. While we do this, you will need to [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join). Once we have the new repo set up and have told our domain name registrar to point to that repo on GitHub, we will then add your newly created GitHub account to be a collaborator for the repo for your university. (You can read more about how GitHub organization accounts work [here](https://github.com/blog/674-introducing-organizations)).

The great part about this is that we can add as many collaborators to a repo as we want. So, for everyone that is part of your dis-orientation group at your university, they can have their own GitHub account and be a collaborator for that repo. Just let us know what all of the GitHub accounts are that we need to add as collaborators to your new repo.

Now that we have your subdomain set up, we will next go over how to work with GitHub. After that, we will go over how to write content, and then we will send you on your merry un-learning and dis-orienting way!

### Step 3: Using GitHub

Broadly speaking, there are two straightforward ways to use GitHub. One of these ways is directly through their website interface, while the other way uses free software that synchronizes the repo on their website with a "clone" of that repo that is stored directly on your computer. If you use the software version, you will then be able to edit the website directly on your computer without an internet connection. After you finish editing the website, all you will need to do is find an internet connection and synchronize the changes that you made on your computer with version of the repo stored on GitHub. (You can also do things from the command line, but we will not cover that here. If you're interested in this option, try poking around the internet for tutorials, if you don't already know to use Git from the command line.)

Here, we will go over both the web interface option and the software application option.

#### GitHub's web interface

- **Details coming soon**

#### GitHub's software application

First, you will need to download the GitHub's native software application. It can be downloaded [here](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git). The website should automatically detect the correct version of the software for your operating system, but if it does not, there are links at the top of page for each operating system. Click on the correct one:
